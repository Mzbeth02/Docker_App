# 🐳 Two-Tier Docker Application (Frontend + Backend)

This project demonstrates how to design, build, and deploy a simple **two-tier application** consisting of a **frontend** (served with Nginx) and a **backend API** (built with Node.js and Express).  
Both services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**
